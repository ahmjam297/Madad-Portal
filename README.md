# Madad-Portal
CEMK HELP PORTAL is a website on which various types of queries and complaints related to various departments such as Academic,
Administrative, Civil, Sports, and Anti-Ragging etc. can be made by users. In the current system all the activities are done
manually. It is very time consuming and inefficient. The CEMK Help Portal will be helpful for students, faculties and staffs
as well. It will make the process more accountable, smooth and efficient. In this portal user can submit their complaints and
queries and check its status after the authentication. As soon as a complaint is registered on the portal an email with all the
information related to the complaint is sent to the head of the respective departments. The head of department can check the
complaints then process it and change its status to in-process, visited and completed etc. 
User can also post blogs and share information with other users. The user can also update and delete blogs posted by them not
others. The complaint records can be viewed in graphical format by the admin only. HODs can view complains related to their
departments only but admin can view all records. Any changes in the complaint status can only be made by the HOD of the concerned
department not by the admin or other users. Hence making the process more accountable and efficient than the previous manual
system.
